We built HireHut because hiring was broken, and we knew it could be better.

As recruiters and engineers, we watched great companies struggle with the same problems: recruiters drowning in resumes, interviews that felt more like coin flips than assessments, and top candidates accepting other offers while hiring managers debated gut feelings.

The cost was real. Hours lost to manual screening. Bad hires that didn't work out. Diverse talent filtered out by unconscious bias. We knew AI could solve these problems, so we built the platform we always wished existed.

## What is HireHut?

HireHut is an AI-powered recruitment platform that automates your entire hiring workflow - from the first resume to the final decision. We handle the tedious work so you can focus on building great teams.

Think of us as your hiring co-pilot. We screen candidates, conduct initial interviews, evaluate technical skills, and deliver comprehensive reports - all while maintaining fairness and consistency that human-only processes can't match.

## The problems we solve

**Lost productivity**  
Recruiters spend 10+ hours per hire just sorting resumes, scheduling interviews, and chasing down feedback. That's time that should be spent talking to candidates and closing offers.

**Inconsistent interviews**  
Every interviewer has their own style, asks different questions, and evaluates differently. Candidates never get a fair comparison, and hiring managers can't make confident decisions.

**Lack of real data**  
Most hiring decisions come down to "I have a good feeling about them." But feelings don't predict performance. You need actual insights into skills, communication, and fit.

**Losing top talent**  
Great candidates are off the market in days, not weeks. Slow processes mean watching your ideal hire accept an offer somewhere else.

HireHut fixes all of this.

## How HireHut works: Your complete hiring workflow

### 1. Automated workflows that save hours

From day one, HireHut handles the repetitive work that bogs down your team.

**Smart job creation**: Our AI helps you write detailed, compelling job descriptions that attract the right candidates. No more staring at blank templates.

**Intelligent resume parsing**: Upload resumes in any format, and we automatically extract skills, experience, and qualifications. The system scores each candidate against your requirements and surfaces the best matches.

**Automated communication**: HireHut sends personalized emails to candidates at every stage - confirmations, interview invitations, follow-ups. You stay in control, but the system handles the execution.

**Seamless scheduling**: Candidates pick interview times from your calendar, with automatic reminders and rescheduling handled by the platform. No more email tennis.

**Visual pipelines**: See every candidate's status at a glance. Drag and drop to move them through stages. Collaborate with your team using comments and ratings.

Our users save an average of 10 hours per hire just on administrative work. That's time back for strategic recruiting.

### 2. AI-powered video interviews that eliminate bias

This is where HireHut really shines. We conduct structured video interviews that evaluate every candidate fairly and consistently.

**How it works**: Candidates receive an interview link and answer pre-set questions on camera. Our AI analyzes their responses in real-time, evaluating communication style, confidence levels, and technical knowledge.

**What we measure**:

- Communication clarity and structure
- Confidence and professional presence
- Technical knowledge and problem-solving approach
- Emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills
- Enthusiasm and cultural alignment

**What you get**: Detailed transcriptions of every answer, sentiment analysis showing engagement levels throughout the interview, and objective performance scores based on job requirements. Every candidate is evaluated using the same criteria, removing the unconscious bias that creeps into traditional interviews.

The impact is significant. Our customers report reducing interview bias by up to 70%, leading to more diverse and higher-quality hires.

### 3. Smart Interview IDE for technical roles

If you're hiring engineers, our technical interview environment is a game-changer.

**Real coding environment**: Candidates code in a fully-featured IDE with support for all major languages. It's not a toy sandbox - it's the real thing.

**Automatic integrity monitoring**: The system tracks everything. Tab switches? Flagged. Copy-paste from external sources? Detected. Unusual patterns? Highlighted. You get a complete picture of how someone actually codes.

**Integrated video**: While they code, their webcam captures their problem-solving process. You can see them thinking through challenges, not just the final solution.

**AI evaluation**: Our AI analyzes code quality, efficiency, logic, and best practices. It identifies potential issues, suggests improvements, and scores performance against benchmarks.

**Real-time analytics**: Watch performance metrics update as candidates work. See time spent per section, error rates, and solution approaches.

This gives you 100% confidence in technical assessments. No more wondering if someone had help or copied solutions. No more inconsistent coding interviews where one person gets hard questions and another gets softballs.

### 4. Comprehensive candidate reports

After every interview, HireHut generates detailed reports that go far beyond "seems like a good fit."

**360-degree candidate view**: Every report includes detailed breakdowns of soft skills (communication, teamwork, leadership) and technical skills (specific to the role). You see exactly what someone can do, not just what they claim.

**Skill radar charts**: Visual comparisons make it easy to see how candidates stack up against each other and against your ideal profile. Who's strong in technical skills but needs development in communication? You'll know at a glance.

**Sentiment timeline**: See emotional engagement throughout the interview. When did they get excited? Where did they struggle? This context helps you understand not just what they said, but how they felt.

**Predictive insights**: Based on historical data and performance patterns, HireHut provides recommendations on candidate success probability. It's not a crystal ball, but it's better than guessing.

**Team collaboration**: Share reports with hiring managers, add comments, compare candidates side-by-side. Everyone works from the same data, leading to faster decisions.

Companies using our reporting see a 30% reduction in mis-hires. Better data means better decisions.

### 5. Seamless integrations with your existing tools

We know you're not starting from scratch. HireHut integrates with the tools you already use:

- **Workday**: Sync job postings, candidates, and hiring data
- **Greenhouse**: Full ATS integration with two-way data flow
- **SAP SuccessFactors**: Enterprise-grade connectivity
- Plus connections to major HRIS platforms and calendar systems

You don't need to rebuild your workflow. HireHut enhances what you already have.

## The AI that powers everything

Behind HireHut are three core AI capabilities that make all of this possible:

**Predictive matching**: Our machine learning models analyze resumes, skills, and experience patterns to predict candidate-role fit. We look at hundreds of data points humans would miss, identifying top talent with precision that improves with every hire.

**Behavioral and sentiment analysis**: During interviews, our AI reads between the lines. Tone of voice, speech patterns, word choice, pause length - all analyzed to build a complete picture of communication style and emotional intelligence.

**Performance benchmarking**: Every candidate is compared against ideal profiles built from successful hires in similar roles. You're not just evaluating in a vacuum - you're measuring against proven success patterns.

This isn't AI for the sake of AI. Every capability solves a real problem that recruiters face.

## Real results from real companies

The numbers tell the story:

**70% faster time-to-hire**: By automating screening and standardizing interviews, companies cut their hiring timeline from months to weeks. Top candidates don't slip away anymore.

**40% lower cost-per-hire**: Less time spent on manual work means your team can handle more roles without adding headcount. Plus, fewer mis-hires means lower turnover costs.

**30% reduction in mis-hires**: Better data leads to better decisions. Companies report significant improvements in new hire performance and retention.

**95% customer satisfaction**: Our support team is obsessive about customer success, and it shows in the ratings.

But beyond the metrics, we hear stories that matter more. Recruiters who finally have time to build real relationships with candidates. Hiring managers who can defend their decisions with data. HR leaders building more diverse teams because bias has been systematically removed.

That's what drives us.

## Why HireHut stands out

**Speed without compromise**: Cut time-to-hire dramatically without sacrificing quality. Our automation handles the busywork while maintaining rigorous evaluation standards.

**Exceptional ROI**: Every hour saved, every bad hire prevented, every top candidate secured - it adds up fast. Most customers see positive ROI within their first few hires.

**Fairness by design**: Unconscious bias is built into human decision-making. Our AI evaluates every candidate using identical criteria, ensuring fair treatment and more diverse hiring outcomes.

**Built for growth**: Whether you're making 5 hires or 500, HireHut scales with you. The platform handles increasing volume without increasing your workload.
